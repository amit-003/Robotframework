Web testing with Robot Framework and SeleniumLibrary




`installation instructions`__.

In practice it is easiest to install Robot Framework and
SeleniumLibrary along with its dependencies using `pip`_ package
manager. Once you have pip installed, all you need to do is running
these commands::

    pip install robotframework
    pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary



 Note: Before running test cases run command line::

    python app/server.py



Running tests
-------------

The `test cases`_ are located in the ``login_tests`` directory. They can be
executed using the ``robot`` command::

    robot login_tests

.. note:: If you are using Robot Framework 2.9 or earlier, you need to
          use the ``pybot`` command instead.

You can also run an individual test case file and use various command line
options supported by Robot Framework::

    robot login_tests/valid_login.robot
    robot --test InvalidUserName --loglevel DEBUG login_tests

Run ``robot --help`` for more information about the command line usage and see
`Robot Framework User Guide`_ for more details about test execution in general.
